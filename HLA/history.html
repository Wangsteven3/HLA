						<h3>History of the Alliance</h3>
						<h4>From Humble Beginnings</h4>

			<p>The HLA was originally organized as the CCNY Office of Experimental Rocketry as a loose association of undergraduate engineering clubs at the Grove School of Engineering interested in continuing the development of at that time GSOE’s two year old rocketry program.
							The roots of this program go back to the CCNY Aerospace Club which competed in the International Cansat Competition and the First Robotics Competition for a number of years in the early 2010’s and before. In the spring and fall of 2014, former and active members of CCNY Aerospace founded the Planetary & Rocket Science Group (PRSG) and secured Chartered membership in the National Association of Rocketry (NAR Section #756). PRSG eventually absorbed the NAR Chapter’s membership, and assumed responsibility over the rocketry program. The 2014-2015 academic year was spent recruiting and training new membership, self-educating in all the basics of amateur rocketry, and searching for a competition or challenge to test the program.

			<p>By the summer of 2015, PRSG discovered the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association (ESRA), and their Inter-collegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC).
							In the search for a new and novel challenge, PRSG also discovered the much neglected field of hybrid rocketry.
							PRSG began organizing Project Messenger with the guidance of Tripoli Rocket Association’s Prefecture 94 (the METRA Rocket Club).
							ESRA is one of three rocket associations in the United States along with the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) and the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA).
							Rocket associations provide the legal and logistical platform for participation in amateur rocket flight across the country. They negotiate the use of private property for rocket launching and organize competitions
							and record trials to stimulate participation in rocketry from all age groups and levels of experience.
							The most exciting niche in amateur rocketry in the US is collegiate experimental rocketry: the flight of Student Researched and Designed (SRAD) rockets.
							This includes the even smaller niche of amateur hybrid rocketry: the flight of rockets with SRAD hybrid rocket engines.</p>

			<p>During the summer of 2016, the CCNY rocket program was organized into a two-project vision.
							Project Messenger would continue for the next two years at least in the IREC competition with three launches intended to perfect a novel and hardly used recovery system concept. Running simultaneously,
							and managed by the CCNY chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Project Aries would begin a two year program to build one of the first paraffin-fueled hybrid rocket engines.
							The CCNY Aerospace Club, reeling after years of poor management, would be taken over and re-purposed in the spring of 2017 to manage technical integration between both Aries and Messenger.
							The association of clubs became briefly the CCNY Office of Experimental Rocketry, which soon after was re-organized as the HLA.</p>
